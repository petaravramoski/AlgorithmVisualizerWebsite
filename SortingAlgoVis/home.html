          Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, a project created by
          Petar Avramoski for my portfolio. This interactive web application is
          designed to showcase the world of sorting algorithms through visual
          representations and hands-on exploration.

          At its core, the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer offers a dynamic
          platform for users to interact with various sorting algorithms,
          providing a unique opportunity to witness the inner workings of these
          algorithms in real-time. Whether you're a computer science enthusiast,
          a student, or simply curious about the mechanics of sorting, this
          project aims to make complex concepts more accessible and engaging.
          Through this visualizer, you can not only gain insights into sorting
          algorithms but also, adjust sorting speeds, and compare the efficiency
          of different algorithms.
